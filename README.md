# todo
This todo list app happens to be my first personal JavaScript project. It's something i did to have a grasp of the language and how the DOM works, so it's not pretty. JavaScript is my first programming language. It's been an intimidating journey so far. Nonetheless, it's fun baby! I love it!!!!

Download the zip file and open the HTML files i your browser. That's it!
